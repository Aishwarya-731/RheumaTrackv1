# RheumaTrack

Multi-joint mobility monitoring and symptom-assessment web application.

RheumaTrack lets a person record pain, stiffness and discomfort per joint, import timestamped joint-angle recordings (MATLAB-generated or externally acquired), review observed range of motion (ROM) over time, compare symptoms with movement, and share read-only reports with a clinician they explicitly invite.

> **RheumaTrack is not a diagnostic system.** It does not diagnose rheumatoid arthritis or any other condition. Observed ROM is *max − min angle in one recording* and has not been clinically validated. No sensor hardware is connected; the hardware interface is documented for future work only.

Project team: **Team KAIZEN** (documentation only — not shown in the application).

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | **22.12 or newer** (LTS 22 or 24) | everything |
| npm | 10+ | everything |
| Java (JDK/JRE) | **21 or newer** (required by firebase-tools 15) | Firebase Emulator Suite (local backend, rules tests, emulator E2E) |
| Python | 3.10+ (optional) | regenerating golden reference values |
| MATLAB / MATLAB Online | R2021a+ (optional) | MATLAB scripts in `matlab/` |

Install Java on Windows/macOS from <https://adoptium.net> (Temurin 21). Check with `java -version`.

## Quick start — fully local, no Firebase account

```bash
# 1. unzip, open the folder in VS Code, then in a terminal:
npm install

# 2. start the local Firebase emulators + the web app together
npm run dev:local
#    App:            http://127.0.0.1:5173
#    Emulator UI:    http://127.0.0.1:4000

# 3. (optional, second terminal) create demo accounts with clearly labelled SYNTHETIC data
npm run seed
```

Demo accounts created by `npm run seed` (local emulator only):

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Patient (has synthetic data, shared with the clinician) | `patient@rheumatrack.test` | `Patient123` |
| Clinician | `clinician@rheumatrack.test` | `Clinician123` |

There are two sign-in pages: **Patients** at `/login` and **Clinicians** at `/clinician/login`. The page you use only decides where you land — access always comes from the account's role, which only an administrator can grant.

You can also sign up a new account in the app. New accounts are always personal (patient) accounts. Someone who signs in on the clinician page without the role can submit a **Request clinician access** form. To make an account a clinician:

```bash
npm run grant-clinician -- --emulator someone@example.com
# then sign out and back in. Clinicians must verify their email to receive invitations;
# in the emulator the verification link is printed in the emulator terminal.
```

Emulator data is in memory and disappears when the emulators stop. Use `npm run emulators:persist` (instead of `npm run emulators`) to save it to `.emulator-data/` between runs.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev:local` | Firebase emulators + Vite dev server against them |
| `npm run emulators` / `npm run dev:emu` | the two halves of `dev:local`, separately |
| `npm run seed` | demo accounts + synthetic data in the emulators |
| `npm run dev` | dev server against a real project from `.env.local` |
| `npm run typecheck` | strict TypeScript check (app, scripts, tests) |
| `npm test` | unit + integration tests (Vitest, jsdom) |
| `npm run test:rules` | Firestore Security Rules tests (starts the Firestore emulator; needs Java) |
| `npm run test:e2e:install` | downloads Playwright's Chromium (once) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | browser E2E against the emulators — run `npm run emulators` and `npm run seed` first |
| `npm run test:e2e:harness` | the same E2E suite against an in-memory test build (no Firebase needed) |
| `npm run build` | type-check + production build into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | serve the production build |
| `npm run deploy` | build and deploy Hosting + Firestore rules/indexes to your project |
| `npm run deploy:rules` | deploy only the Firestore Security Rules and indexes (needed after v1.1) |
| `npm run grant-clinician -- …` | grant/revoke the clinician role (Admin SDK) |
| `npm run golden` | regenerate `reference/golden/expected.json` with the Python reference |

## Testing

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test                    # 135 unit/integration tests
npm run test:rules          # needs Java
npm run test:e2e:install
npm run test:e2e:harness    # no Firebase needed
npm run emulators & npm run seed && npm run test:e2e   # full stack
```

What each suite covers and what was actually run before delivery is listed in [docs/VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

## Firebase setup (real project) and deployment

Step-by-step instructions, including App Check, granting clinician roles, backups and retention: **[docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md](docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md)**. In short:

1. Create a Firebase project (the free Spark plan is sufficient), add a **Web app**, enable **Authentication → Email/Password**, create a **Cloud Firestore** database.
2. `cp .env.example .env.local` and fill in the web-app values.
3. `npx firebase login` and `npx firebase use --add` (choose your project).
4. `npm run deploy` (builds, then deploys Hosting, Security Rules and indexes).
5. Grant clinicians with a service-account key kept **outside** the project folder:
   `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/key.json npm run grant-clinician -- --project <id> doc@example.com`

## MATLAB workflow

See **[matlab/README.md](matlab/README.md)** — generating synthetic data in MATLAB Online, exporting CSV/JSON, analysing a session, and verifying that MATLAB, Python and the web app produce identical metrics.

## Project structure

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| “Setup required” page | No Firebase config. Use `npm run dev:local`, or create `.env.local` from `.env.example`. |
| `firebase: command not found` | Use the npm scripts (they use the local `firebase-tools`), or `npx firebase …`. |
| Emulators fail: “Could not spawn java” | Install Java 21+ and reopen the terminal. |
| Port 8080 / 9099 / 5173 in use | Stop the other process, or change ports in `firebase.json` and the `VITE_EMULATOR_*` variables. |
| Patient sees “Clinician account not found” | The clinician has no role yet, or has not signed in since it was granted — see [docs/SHARING.md](docs/SHARING.md). |
| Clinician sees no invitations | Check the patient used the clinician's sign-in email; see [docs/SHARING.md](docs/SHARING.md#troubleshooting). |
| Phone sensor says “needs https” | Open the deployed (https) site on the phone, not an `http://` address. |
| 3D viewer blank | The browser must support WebGL (enable hardware acceleration). |
| `npm run golden` fails on Windows | Use `python reference/python/rt_analysis.py --write-expected reference/golden`. |
